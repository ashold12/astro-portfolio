        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          <!-- change to three identical shirts -->
          Carpenter turned coder. I’m a full stack software engineer currently residing in the beautiful Duluth, MN. I enjoy tackling complex problems head on, and using my creative process to deliver efficient minimalist solutions.<br/><br/>

          I love the process of automation both in code and in life. Whether it be owning three identical shirts, driving the same car for eight years, or using homemade desk built with recycled materials; I’ve been notorious among my peers for my practical minimalism. I was not ashamed of this quality but rather proud of it. I maintain this characteristic in my work, by striving to generate reusable component structures which are understood intuitively.<br/><br/>

          When I’m not at my computer you can catch me outside, which I consider to be my natural habitat. I love the summer sun, exploring the local bodies of water to find new swim spots, frisbee/frisbee golf, hiking, or tossing around a ball with whomever will join me. I’m also a lover of music, and served as a percussionist and jazz drummer in highschool before joining a cover band in college.
