  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    <!-- change to three identical shirts -->
    Carpenter turned coder. I’m a full stack software engineer currently residing
    in the beautiful Duluth, MN. I enjoy tackling complex problems head on, and using
    my creative process to deliver efficient minimalist solutions.<br /><br />

    I love the process of automation both in code and in life. Whether it be
    owning three identical shirts, driving the same car for eight years, or
    using homemade desk built with recycled materials; I’ve been notorious among
    my peers for my practical minimalism. I was not ashamed of this quality but
    rather proud of it. I maintain this characteristic in my work, by striving
    to generate reusable component structures which are understood intuitively.<br
    /><br />

    When I’m not at my computer you can catch me outside, which I consider to be
    my natural habitat. I love the summer sun, exploring the local bodies of
    water to find new swim spots, frisbee/frisbee golf, hiking, or tossing
    around a ball with whomever will join me. I’m also a lover of music, and
    served as a percussionist and jazz drummer in highschool before joining a
    cover band in college.
